A more complex implementation of the AWS Lambda function in Node.js that authenticates users using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

This function performs the following additional tasks:

It catches any errors that occur while verifying the JWT and returns a 401 Unauthorized response.
It retrieves the user's details from the database or cache using the user's ID from the decoded JWT.
It checks if the user is authorized to access the resource by checking their role and the requested resource. If the user is not authorized, it returns a 403 Forbidden response.
You can adjust this function to meet your specific needs, such as using a different method to extract the JWT from the request or adding additional checks to the user's details and permissions.
