A simple AWS Lambda function in Node.js that authenticates users using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

This function extracts the JWT from the request headers, verifies it using a secret key, and then decodes its payload to check if it contains the user's ID. If the JWT is valid and contains the user's ID, the function returns a successful response. Otherwise, it returns an error.

You can adjust this function to meet your specific needs, such as using a different method to extract the JWT from the request or adding additional checks to the decoded JWT.
