This is an AWS Lambda function written in Node.js that creates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using the jsonwebtoken library. 
The function takes two pieces of information as input: the user ID of the user who is logging in, and the password hash of the user.

The function first retrieves the user from an AWS DynamoDB database using the user ID. It then verifies that the user exists and that the password hash provided in the request matches the password hash stored in the database. If either of these checks fails, then the function returns an error response with the appropriate status code (404 if the user was not found, or 401 if the password hash is incorrect).

If the user exists and the password is correct, then the function retrieves the JWT secret from AWS Secrets Manager and uses it to create a new JWT using the user ID and role as the payload. The JWT is then returned as the output of the function, along with a status code of 200 (OK) to indicate that the request was successful.

You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case, such as by changing the secret name, region, or table name. You may also want to include additional information in the response, such as the user's name or other claims.
