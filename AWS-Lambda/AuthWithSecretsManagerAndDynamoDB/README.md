In this example, the JWT token is extracted from the Authorization header of the HTTP request. If the token is successfully verified and the user is retrieved from the DynamoDB database, then the Lambda function returns a response with a status code of 200 (OK) and a message indicating that the user was authenticated successfully. If any errors occur, or if the user is not found in the database, then the Lambda function returns a response with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) and a message indicating that the user authentication failed.

You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case, such as by changing the secret name, region, or table name. You may also want to include additional information in the response, such as the user's ID or name.
